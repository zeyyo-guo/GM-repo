# function
## condition
  * if()
    * one-line actions don't need braces
  * nested if()
  * Combining Booleans: && and ||
    * Use && and || for control, & and | for subsetting
  * switch()
  
## iteration 
  * for()
    * the body of the for() loop : if() clauses; other for() loop.
  * while(): conditional iteration

## Vectorized conditions: ifelse()
  * 1st argument is a Boolean vector, then pick from the 2nd or 3rd vector arguments as TRUE or FALSE

## Unconditional iteration
### "Manual" control over iteration
  * break() exits the loop
  * next() skips the rest of the body and goes back into the loop 
  
# why function
  Data structures tie related values into one object;
  Functions tie related commands into one object.

## conponent
  * interfaces:inputs or arguments
  * output or return value
  * comments: description of purpose; listing of arguments; listing of outputs 
  
## what should a function
  * Named and default arguments
    * Default values get used if names are missing
    * Named arguments can go in any order when explicitly tagged
  * Checking Arguments
    * stopifnot() are a series of expressions which should all be TRUE

## Summary
  * Functions bundle related commands together into objects: easier to rerun, easier to re-use, easier to combine, easier to modify, less risk of error,easier to think about
  * Interfaces control what the function can see (arguments, environment) and change (its internals, its return value)
  * Calling functions we define works just like calling built-in functions:named arguments, defaults
  
# extend function
## Multiple functions: Doing different things to the same object
  * Make the model one object; assume it has certain components
  * Consistent Interfaces: arguments and structure
  * Put all the related functions in a single file; Source them together

## Sub-functions: Breaking up big jobs into small ones
  * "Rule of thumb: A function longer than a page is probably too long"
  * "Rule of thumb: If you find yourself writing the same code in multiple places,make it a separate function"
  * Cons: Gets re-declared each time, can't access in global environment

## summary
  * Multiple functions let us do multiple related jobs, either on the same object
or on similar ones
  * Sub-functions let us break big problems into smaller ones, and re-use the
solutions to the smaller ones
  * Recursion is a powerful way of making hard problems simpler
  
# Top-downdesignofprograms
  1.Start with the big-picture view of the problem
    * Resources
    * Requirements
  2.Break the problem into a few big parts
    * Try to break the calculation into a few (say â‰¤ 5) parts
  3.Figure out how to fit the parts together
    * Write top-level code for the function which puts those steps together
  4.Go do this for each part    
  
## pros
  * Top-down design fits naturally with functional coding
  * Top-down design makes debugging easier
  * Top-down design makes testing easier
  
## workflow
  * Thinking Algorithmically
  * Combining the Practices
  * Re-factoring
  * Grouping into Objects
  * Extracting the Common Sub-Task
  * ExtractingGeneral Operations

## summary
  * Top-down design is a recursive heuristic for coding
  * Leads to multiple short functions, each solving a limited problem
  * Disciplines you to think algorithmically
  * Once you have working code, re-factor it to make it look more like it came
from a top-down design
